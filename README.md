# Event Registration

This example of a reservation Tapp provides your customers with the possibility to sign up for an event. The design is similar to the event Tapp with the addition of a register button that is used for the sign-in. Furthermore, the Tapp makes use of user account control groups (UAC-groups), to track the attendees of an event and check them in. Attendees can be checked in by scanning either their QR code or OPM transpondercard connected to their chaynsÂ® account.
